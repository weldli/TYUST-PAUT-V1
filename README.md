The **TYUST-PAUT-V1** dataset was collected by our team in the actual production environments of Shanxi Yangmei Chemical Machinery (Group) Co., Ltd. and Taiyuan Boiler Group Co., Ltd. It contains ultrasonic phased array (PAUT) images obtained under different welding processes and material conditions, primarily for detecting internal weld defects, as illustrated below. The dataset mainly includes four types of defects: **non-critical**, **unfused**, **incomplete penetration**, and **air-hole**.

Ultrasonic phased array technology controls the beam direction and focusing by adjusting the excitation phases of the probe array, thereby producing high-resolution images that enable more accurate identification and localization of internal weld defects. However, due to imaging characteristics, the visual appearances of weld defects in the images can be very similar. This makes the **TYUST-PAUT dataset** an ideal benchmark for evaluating a modelâ€™s ability to locate and identify internal weld defects in complex industrial environments, and it provides an effective means of validating model performance and robustness in real-world scenarios.
